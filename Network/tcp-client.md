- When to use?
>  If you are working within the confines of large enterprise environments, you won’t have the luxury of networking tools or compilers, and sometimes you’ll even be missing the absolute basics like the ability to copy/paste or an Internet connection. This is where being able to quickly create a TCP client comes in extremely handy. 

```
import socket

target_host = "www.google.com"
target_port = 80

# create a socket object
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# connect the client
client.connect((target_host, target_port))

# send some data
client.send(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:www.google.com\r\n\r\n")

# receive data
response = client.recv(4096)

client.close()

print(response)

```

- `client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
> - `AF_INET` means standart ipv4 address or hostname is going to be used
> - `SOCK_STREAM` indicates this will be a TCP Client
